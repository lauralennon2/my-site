            <p align="center">
                I love traveling. I have been lucky enough to have traveled to so many amazing places. My top 3 places that I have been to are Italy, London, and the Philippines. Over this summer I am traveling to Ireland which I am really excited about. One place that I would love to vist if given the opportunity is Greece. I love traveling because you get to experience new cultures, architecture, language, and cuisine.

            <p align="center">
                I love watching sports like football and collge basketball. I am from outside Philly so obviously I am a big Eagles fan. I love watching the game with my Dad on the TV or in person at Lincoln Financial Field. I also am a big Villanova Basketball fan. I enjoy watching sports becasue it brings a competative side in me, something I don't normally have.

              <h3 align="center">Music</h3>
            <p align="center">
                I love listening to music. When I was younger I used to play the piano, the guitar, and I sang. Now I dont really keep up with any of those hobbies but every now and then I like to try and play a song on the guitar. I view music as something you can relax to and really take in. I also really love watching music videos and seeing what the artist wanted to portray in their videos.

            <h3 align="center">Baking and Cooking</h3>
            <p align="center">
                I love baking and cooking. Both of my parents do not know how to cook so growing up I had to learn how to bake and cook if I wanted a homecooked meal. My Aunt played a big part in my love for baking especially because she taught me how to bake pies and cookies. Cooking food is like a little escape from the real world. I also love trying new recipes that I find and make.

            <h3 align="center">Playing Tennis and Golf</h3>
            <p align="center">
                I grew up playing and taking lessons for tennis and golf. When I was younger I used to have tennis and golf lessons every week and I even went to summer camp for both. In middle and high school I played on my schools tennis team. Now that I am in college I only really play with my friends and family but it still is a fun hobbie to have and keep up with.

            <h3 align="center">Watching TV</h3>
            <p align="center">
               I love watching TV and I have recently been trying to get more into movies. Some of my favorite TV shows are New girl, Scandal, Euphoria, and You. Some of my favorite movies are Kingsman, Bride and Predjudice, She's the Man, and Clueless. I love watching TV and movies because it offers a space where I can relax and enjoy whatever I am watching.
