    <h3 align="center">Volunteer Experience:</h3>
    <p>
I participated in many community service endeavors throughout high school and college including but not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>After school tutoring in Philadelphia</li>
    <li>Volunteering at <a href="https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/">Cradles To Crayons</a> and <a href="https://www.philabundance.org/">Philabundance</a></li>
    <li>Was a member of the planning committee for Eat Your Way, my sororities philanthropy event where we raised money for Prevent Child Abuse America</li>
</ul>
My favorite volunteer experience that I have participated in is my Community Service, Leadership, Cultural Immersion, and Language Immersion trip to China. On this trip I experienced volunteering at a local farm in the Yunnan Province of China, and helped townspeople make mudbricks to rebuild a building that had fallen into dispair. I also learned more about Chinese culture and practiced my Mandarian. This trip really introduced me to my love for community service and played a big part into why I decided to major in Public Health.
