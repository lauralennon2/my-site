    <p>
        In high school my main activities included being a doubles player on the Varsity Girls Tennis Team and being an Editor and Photographer for the School Yearbook. I also participated in Patriot Ambassadors where I gave tours of the school to perspective students and their families. One after school program participated in frequently was an after school tutoring program where I would travel to Philadelphia to tutor children from our schools Community Partnership School. I was also lucky enough to get to travel to Poland and across Europe with my schools Choir.
