    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Laura Lennon and im from Plymouth Meeting, Penslyvania. I went to high school at Germantown Academy and I am now a Sophomore at George Washington University majoring in Public Health and minoring in Business and Criminal Justice. I hope to one day get a job in Healthcare Administration.

    <p>In high school I was on the Varsity Girls Tennis Team and was an Editor and Photographer for the School Yearbook. I also participated in Patriot Ambassadors where I gave tours of the school to perspective students and their families. I also frequently participated in an after school tutoring program where I would travel to Philadelphia to tutor children from our schools Community Partnership School.</p>
