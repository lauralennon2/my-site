    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Laura Lennon and im from Plymouth Meeting, Penslyvania. I went to high school at Germantown Academy and I am now a Sophomore at George Washington University majoring in Public Health and minoring in Business and Criminal Justice. I hope to one day get a job in Healthcare Administration.

    <h3>High School Activities:</h3>
    <p>
        In high school my main activities included being a doubles player on the Varsity Girls Tennis Team and being an Editor and Photographer for the School Yearbook. I also participated in Patriot Ambassadors where I gave tours of the school to perspective students and their families. One after school program participated in frequently was an after school tutoring program where I would travel to Philadelphia to tutor children from our schools Community Partnership School. I was also lucky enough to get to travel to Poland and across Europe with my schools Choir. 
    </p>
    <h3>College Activities:</h3>
    <p>
        In college I currently am apart of the sorority Sigma Delta Tau and a club called GlobeMed. Within my sorority a held a previous position on Co-Chair of Diversity, Equity, and Enclusion and this year I just became the new, and first, Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. In Globemed I am apart of the Outreach Committee where I help reach out to other clubs to spread the word about GlobeMed's philanthropy and possibly partner in hosting an event.
